    " **Q1. Inheriting from the Exception Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance:** Custom exceptions inherit from the `Exception` class to become part of Python's exception hierarchy. This allows them to be caught and handled like any built-in exception.\n",
    "- **Exception Handling Mechanisms:** Python's exception handling mechanisms (try/except blocks) are designed to work with objects derived from `Exception`.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** By inheriting from `Exception`, custom exceptions can be used interchangeably with built-in exceptions in exception handling blocks, promoting code flexibility and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Printing Python Exception Hierarchy**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pprint\n",
    "\n",
    "pprint.pprint(list(BaseException.__subclasses__()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. ArithmeticError Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Errors:** `OverflowError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `FloatingPointError`\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# OverflowError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 2 ** 1000000  # Exponent too large, exceeds maximum representable value\n",
    "except OverflowError:\n",
    "    print(\"Numeric calculation resulted in an overflow\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. LookupError Class**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Base class for key-related and index-related errors.\n",
    "- **KeyError:** Occurs when attempting to access a non-existent key in a dictionary.\n",
    "- **IndexError:** Occurs when trying to access an index out of range in a sequence (list, tuple, string).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# KeyError\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_dict[\"age\"])  # Non-existent key\n",
    "except KeyError:\n",
    "    print(\"Key not found in the dictionary\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# IndexError\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_list[5])  # Index out of range\n",
    "except IndexError:\n",
    "    print(\"Index out of range in the list\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. ImportError and ModuleNotFoundError**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ImportError:** Occurs when there's an issue importing a module.\n",
    "- **ModuleNotFoundError:** A specific subclass of `ImportError` raised when a module isn't found in the Python path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Best Practices for Exception Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use try/except blocks for anticipated errors.\n",
    "- Choose specific exception types for targeted handling.\n",
    "- Raise meaningful custom exceptions for application-specific errors.\n",
    "- Avoid bare `except` blocks that catch all exceptions (unless necessary for cleanup).\n",
    "- Provide informative error messages to aid debugging.\n",
    "- Use `else` blocks for code"
