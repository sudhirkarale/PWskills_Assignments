    "## Wine Quality Data Set (Q1 & Q2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. Key Features and Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The wine quality dataset includes 12 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed acidity:** Amount of tartaric acid. Higher values might indicate under-ripeness.\n",
    "2. **Volatile acidity:** Amount of acetic acid. High values indicate spoilage.\n",
    "3. **Citric acid:** Organic acid affecting flavor. May influence sourness.\n",
    "4. **Residual sugar:** Unfermented sugars. May affect sweetness and fermentation.\n",
    "5. **Chlorides:** Level of chlorides. May influence wine's taste. \n",
    "6. **Free sulfur dioxide:** Preservative affecting shelf life and taste.\n",
    "7. **Total sulfur dioxide:** Total SO2 (free + bound). Too much can affect taste.\n",
    "8. **Density:** Wine's mass per unit volume. May indicate sugar content.\n",
    "9. **pH:** Acidity level. Affects taste and microbial stability.\n",
    "10. **Sulphates:** Level of sulphates. May influence bitterness.\n",
    "11. **Alcohol:** Alcohol content by volume. Affects body, aroma, and sweetness.\n",
    "12. **Quality (target):** Wine quality score (0-10) based on sensory evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acidity (fixed, volatile, citric) affects taste and preservation.\n",
    "- Sugar (residual) influences sweetness and fermentation.\n",
    "- Chemical compounds (chlorides, SO2, sulphates) impact taste and shelf life.\n",
    "- Density might indicate sugar content.\n",
    "- pH affects taste and stability.\n",
    "- Alcohol content influences body, aroma, and sweetness.\n",

    "**Q2. Handling Missing Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data can be handled in various ways during feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deletion:** Remove rows/columns with missing values (simplest but loses information).\n",
    "* **Mean/Median imputation:** Replace missing values with mean/median of the feature (easy but might not reflect true distribution).\n",
    "* **Mode imputation:** Replace with the most frequent value (useful for categorical data).\n",
    "* **Model-based imputation:** Use machine learning to predict missing values (complex but potentially more accurate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages/Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deletion: Easy but reduces data size and might introduce bias.\n",
    "* Mean/Median imputation: Simple but might not capture true variability.\n",
    "* Mode imputation: Fast for categorical data, but might not be representative.\n",
    "* Model-based imputation: More accurate but requires additional modeling effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach depends on the amount of missing data, its distribution, and the nature of the features.\n",

    "## Student Performance Data Set (Q3 & Q4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Factors Affecting Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Student performance can be influenced by various factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Individual factors:** Age, prior knowledge, learning style, motivation, study habits, stress levels.\n",
    "* **Academic factors:** Difficulty of course, teaching quality, workload, assessment methods.\n",
    "* **Socioeconomic factors:** Family background, access to resources, socioeconomic status.\n",
    "* **External factors:** Health, personal circumstances, disruptions (e.g., COVID-19).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analyzing Factors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive statistics:** Summarize central tendency (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation).\n",
    "* **Correlation analysis:** Identify relationships between variables (e.g., study hours vs. grades).\n",
    "* **Regression analysis:** Model the relationship between performance (dependent variable) and other factors (independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, and creating new features for your model. For student performance data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selection:** Choose relevant features like study hours, attendance, test scores.\n",
    "* **Transformation:** Standardize scores or create categorical variables (e.g., high/low motivation).\n",
    "* **Creation:** Calculate ratios like time spent studying per unit material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of techniques depends on the specific dataset and research goals.\n",

    "## Wine Quality Data Set - EDA & PCA (Q5 & Q6)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use libraries like pandas to load the data and perform EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the data\n",
    "data = pd.read_csv(\"wine_quality.csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyze feature distributions\n",
    "data.hist(figsize=(10,10))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate histograms for each feature. Look for features with skewed or non-normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformations for Non-normality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logarithmic transformation:** For features with positive skew (e.g., volatile acidity).\n",
    "* **Square root transformation:** For features with right skew.\n",
    "* **Box-Cox transformation:** More general purpose for various non-normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use libraries like scikit-learn to perform PCA:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.decomposition import"
