    "**Que 1: Seaborn Plots**\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn, built on top of Matplotlib, provides a high-level interface for creating informative and visually appealing statistical graphics. Here are five common Seaborn plots with their uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Line Plot:** Visualizes trends over time or continuous variables.\n",
    "   - Use cases: Showing changes in stock prices, temperature variations across days, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scatter Plot:** Depicts relationships between two continuous variables.\n",
    "   - Use cases: Exploring correlations between features (e.g., weight vs. height).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bar Plot:** Compares categories using rectangular bars proportional to their values.\n",
    "   - Use cases: Comparing company profits, movie ratings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Box Plot:** Summarizes data distribution, showing quartiles and potential outliers.\n",
    "   - Use cases: Comparing variability in datasets (e.g., income levels across professions).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Violin Plot:** Combines a box plot with a kernel density estimation, providing a clearer view of distribution shapes.\n",
    "   - Use cases: Visualizing distributions with potential non-normality or skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Que 2: Line Plot with \"fmri\" Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the fmri dataset\n",
    "fmri = sns.load_dataset(\"fmri\")\n",
