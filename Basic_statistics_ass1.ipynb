    "Understanding the level of measurement is crucial because it determines the types of statistical analyses and operations that can be performed on the data. For instance, while you can find the mean of interval and ratio data, it doesn't make sense for nominal or ordinal data. Misinterpreting the level of measurement can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, averaging ordinal data like rankings could be misleading as it doesn't account for the differences in significance between ranks."

    "Measures of Variability: These measures describe the spread or dispersion of data points.\n",
    "Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of variability.\n",
    "Standard Deviation: A measure of the average deviation of data points from the mean. It indicates the spread of data around the mean.\n",
    "Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean. It provides a measure of the overall variability of the dataset."
