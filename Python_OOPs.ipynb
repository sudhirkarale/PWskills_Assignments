    "**Q1. Class and Object**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class:** A blueprint that defines the properties (attributes) and behavior (methods) of objects. It serves as a template for creating objects.\n",
    "- **Object:** An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity in the program with its own set of attributes and methods. Objects interact with each other to achieve the program's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "  \"\"\"A simple Animal class.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, species):  # Constructor (special method)\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.species = species\n",
    "\n",
    "  def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Simulates an animal making a sound.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(f\"{self.name} the {self.species} makes a sound!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects (instances) of the Animal class\n",
    "dog = Animal(\"Buddy\", \"Dog\")\n",
    "cat = Animal(\"Whiskers\", \"Cat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog.make_sound()  # Output: Buddy the Dog makes a sound!\n",
    "cat.make_sound()  # Output: Whiskers the Cat makes a sound!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Animal` is the class defining the attributes `name` and `species`, and the method `make_sound`.\n",
    "- `dog` and `cat` are objects (instances) of the `Animal` class. They have their own unique values for `name` and `species`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Four Pillars of OOP**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (class). This promotes data protection and controlled access.\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:** Creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses). This promotes code reuse and organization.\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. This allows for flexible and dynamic function calls.\n",
    "4. **Abstraction:** Focusing on the essential functionalities and hiding implementation details. This simplifies code and promotes reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. __init__() function**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python classes called the constructor.\n",
    "- It's automatically invoked when an object of the class is created.\n",
    "- Its purpose is to initialize the object's attributes with default or provided values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "    self.make = make\n",
    "    self.model = model\n",
    "    self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "  def start(self):\n",
    "    print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model} (year {self.year}) has started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a car object\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2023)\n",
    "my_car.start()  # Output: The Honda Civic (year 2023) has started.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__()` function takes `make`, `model`, and `year` as arguments and initializes the corresponding attributes of the `Car` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Self parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `self` parameter is a reference to the current object instance within a class method.\n",
    "- It's used to access and modify the object's attributes within methods.\n",
    "- Without `self`, methods wouldn't be able to access or modify object-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "  def greet(self):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `self.name` and `self.age` within the `greet()` method refer to the specific attributes of the `person1` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance allows you to create new classes (subclasses) that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes (superclasses).\n",
    "- There are three main types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Single Inheritance:** A subclass inherits from one superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "      def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Dog(Animal):"
