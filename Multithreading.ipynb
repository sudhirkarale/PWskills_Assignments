    "**1. Multithreading in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:** Multithreading allows a Python program to execute multiple sequences of instructions (threads) concurrently. This creates the illusion of parallelism, where the CPU appears to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** Multithreading is beneficial for:\n",
    "  - Performing I/O-bound operations (waiting for external resources like network requests or disk access) efficiently. The main thread can continue execution while other threads wait for I/O.\n",
    "  - Simulating multiple activities or processes within a single program.\n",
    "- **Module:** The `threading` module provides functions and classes for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `threading` Module Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`activeCount()`:** Returns the number of active threads (excluding the main thread).\n",
    "- **`currentThread()`:** Returns the thread object representing the currently executing thread.\n",
    "- **`enumerate()`:** Returns a list of all currently active thread objects (including the main thread).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def thread_info():\n",
    "  print(f\"Active threads: {threading.activeCount()}\")\n",
    "  print(f\"Current thread: {threading.currentThread()}\")\n",
    "  print(f\"All threads: {threading.enumerate()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "main_thread = threading.currentThread()\n",
    "print(\"Main thread information:\")\n",
    "thread_info()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and start a new thread\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=thread_info)\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"After creating a new thread:\")\n",
    "thread_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Thread Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`run()`:** This method is the core of the thread's functionality. It defines the code the thread will execute when started. However, you typically don't call `run()` directly; the `threading` module handles its invocation when the thread starts.\n",
    "- **`start()`:** Starts the thread's execution. The `run()` method is called in a separate control flow, allowing the thread to run concurrently with other threads.\n",
    "- **`join()`:** Blocks the calling thread (usually the main thread) until the target thread finishes its execution. This ensures the main thread doesn't exit before child threads complete their work.\n",
    "- **`isAlive()`:** Returns `True` if the thread is alive (still running or hasn't finished), `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Python Program for Squares and Cubes**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares(num):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Prints the squares of numbers up to `num`.\"\"\"\n",
    "  for i in range(1, num + 1):\n",
    "    print(f\"Square of {i}: {i * i}\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some processing time\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes(num):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Prints the cubes of numbers up to `num`.\"\"\"\n",
    "  for i in range(1, num + 1):\n",
    "    print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i * i * i}\")\n",
    "    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some processing time\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "  thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares, args=(5,))\n",
    "  thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes, args=(5,))\n",
    "\n",
    "  thread1.start()\n",
    "  thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "  thread1.join()\n",
    "  thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "  print(\"Main thread finished execution.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This program demonstrates how to create separate threads to calculate and print squares and cubes concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved responsiveness for I/O-bound tasks (the program doesn't freeze while waiting for external resources).\n",
    "- Simpler simulation of multiple activities or processes.\n",
    "- Potential performance gains by utilizing multiple CPU cores effectively (if tasks can be genuinely parallelized).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased complexity: Managing multiple threads requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions and deadlocks (explained below).\n",
    "- Debugging challenges: Issues between threads can be more difficult to pinpoint compared to single-threaded code.\n",
    "- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitation: Python's GIL introduces some overhead, and within a single Python process, threads won't always run truly in parallel, but rather in quick slices of execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Deadlocks and Race Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deadlock:** A situation where two or more threads are permanently blocked waiting for resources held by each other. Neither thread can proceed, leading to a program stall.\n",
    "- **Race Condition:** A scenario where the outcome of a program depends on the unpredictable timing of thread execution. Race conditions can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption if"
