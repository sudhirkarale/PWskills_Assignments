    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports:** `requests` for fetching web content, `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing, `csv` for CSV file handling.\n",
    "2. **Base URL:** Stores the base URL of the PW Foundation YouTube channel.\n",
    "3. **`extract_video_details` Function:**\n",
    "   - Takes a video URL as input.\n",
    "   - Fetches the content using `requests.get`.\n",
    "   - Parses the HTML with `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "   - Locates the video details container (may require adjustments based on website structure).\n",
    "   - Extracts the video URL, thumbnail URL, title, number of views, and time of posting using appropriate selectors (may require adjustments based on website structure).\n",
    "   - Handles potential exceptions if view count or upload time elements are not found.\n",
    "   - Returns all extracted details or `None` if details are unavailable.\n",
    "4. **Extracting and Saving Video Details:**\n",
    "   - Initializes an empty list `data` to store video details.\n",
    "   - Iterates through the first five video pages by constructing URLs with appropriate parameters.\n",
    "   - Calls `extract_video_details` for each video URL.\n",
    "   - Appends extracted details to the `data` list if available.\n",
    "   - Opens a CSV file for writing with `newline=''` to avoid extra blank lines on Windows.\n",
    "   - Creates a CSV writer object.\n",
    "   - Writes the header row with field names.\n",
    "   - Writes each video's details as a row using `writer.writerows`.\n",
    "   - Prints a success message.\n"
