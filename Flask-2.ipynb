    "**Q1. GET and POST Methods in Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GET:** A fundamental HTTP method used to retrieve data from a server. It typically fetches information from a resource identified by the URL and any query parameters included. GET requests are often used for form submissions without modifying data on the server. The data sent with a GET request is appended to the URL as a query string (e.g., `/users?name=Alice&age=30`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **POST:** Another essential HTTP method used to submit data to a server. It's commonly employed for form submissions that create or update data on the server side. The data is sent in the request body, not visible in the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. The `request` Object in Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Flask, the `request` object provides access to information about the current HTTP request. It contains various attributes like:\n",
    "    - `method`: The HTTP method used for the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).\n",
    "    - `args`: A dictionary containing query parameters from a GET request.\n",
    "    - `form`: A dictionary containing form data from a POST request.\n",
    "    - `json`: Parsed JSON data from the request body (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically use `request` within your Flask routes to process data received from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Using `redirect()` in Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `redirect()` function in Flask is used to redirect a user to a different URL after processing a request. It offers several ways to accomplish this:\n",
    "    - `redirect(url)`: Redirects to the specified absolute URL (e.g., `redirect('https://www.example.com')`).\n",
    "    - `redirect(url_for('endpoint_name'))`: Redirects to a URL generated using `url_for()` (useful for dynamic routing).\n",
    "    - `redirect(to, status_code=302)`: Allows specifying a status code (e.g., `302 Found` for standard redirects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Templates in Flask: Jinja2 Templating**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Templates:** Templates define the structure and layout of your web pages in Flask. They are written in HTML and can include dynamic elements using a templating engine.\n",
    "- **`render_template()`:** This function is used to render a template and populate it with data from your Flask application. It takes the template name and optional keyword arguments containing the data to be passed to the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining templates and `render_template()`, you can create reusable and dynamic web pages in Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Building a Simple API and Testing with Postman**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's an example of a Flask API endpoint that accepts a name and returns a greeting using `request.json` and `jsonify`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/greet', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def greet():\n",
    "    name = request.json.get('name')  # Extract name from JSON data\n",
    "    if name:\n",
    "        return jsonify({'message': f'Hello, {name}!'})\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing name in request body'}), 400  # Bad request\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing with Postman:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open Postman and create a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/greet` (assuming your Flask app runs on port 5000).\n",
    "2. In the Body tab, select \"JSON\" and enter a request body like `{\"name\": \"Alice\"}`.\n",
    "3. Send the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"message\": \"Hello, Alice!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Screenshot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I cannot directly display screenshots within a response. However, Postman should display the JSON response as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code defines a Flask app and a route `/greet` that accepts only POST requests.\n",
    "- Inside the route function:\n",
    "    - `request.json` extracts the JSON data from the request body.\n",
    "    - The code checks for the presence of a `name` key in the JSON data.\n",
    "    - If `name` exists, a JSON response with a greeting message is created using `jsonify`.\n",
    "    - If `name` is missing, a bad request (400) response with an error message is returned."
