    "**Q1. Database vs. SQL vs. NoSQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database:** A structured collection of data organized for efficient access, storage, and manipulation. It typically uses a schema (definition of data structure) to enforce data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A standardized language for interacting with relational databases. It uses a set of keywords and commands to query, manipulate, and manage data stored in tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL (Not Only SQL):** A category of databases that provide a more flexible data model compared to relational databases. NoSQL databases are often used for unstructured or semi-structured data, and they generally offer higher scalability and performance for certain types of workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. DDL (Data Definition Language):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- DDL statements are used to define the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting tables and other database objects like indexes and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE:** Creates a new database object (e.g., `CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);`)\n",
    "- **DROP:** Deletes an existing database object (e.g., `DROP TABLE table_name;`)\n",
    "- **ALTER:** Modifies the structure of an existing database object (e.g., `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN new_column datatype;`)\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows from a table, but retains the table structure itself (e.g., `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. DML (Data Manipulation Language):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- DML statements are used to manipulate data within existing tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INSERT:** Adds new rows (records) to a table (e.g., `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);`)\n",
    "- **UPDATE:** Modifies existing data in a table (e.g., `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = new_value WHERE condition;`)\n",
    "- **DELETE:** Removes rows from a table (e.g., `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. DQL (Data Query Language):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- DQL statements are used to retrieve data from a database. DQL primarily consists of the `SELECT` statement, which allows you to specify which columns and rows to retrieve and apply filtering and aggregation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 20;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Primary Key and Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key:** A unique identifier (column or combination of columns) within a table that ensures no two rows have the same value. It enforces data integrity and allows for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "- **Foreign Key:** A column in one table that references the primary key of another table. This establishes a relationship between tables, allowing for linking data across them and maintaining data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  customer_id INT,\n",
    "  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(255)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Python with MySQL Connector**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python program demonstrating connection to MySQL and using `cursor()` and `execute()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database connection details\n",
    "db_name = \"your_database_name\"\n",
    "user_name = \"your_username\"\n",
    "password = \"your_password\"\n",
    "host = \"localhost\"  # Or the IP address of your MySQL server\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the database\n",
    "mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    database=db_name,\n",
    "    user=user_name,\n",
    "    password=password,\n",
    "    host=host\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a cursor object\n",
    "mycursor = mydb.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example SQL statement (replace with your desired query)\n",
    "sql = \"SELECT * FROM your_table_name;\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the query\n",
    "mycursor.execute(sql)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch results (if applicable)\n",
    "myresult = mycursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process results (e.g., print data)\n",
    "for row in myresult:\n",
    "  print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "mycursor.close()\n",
    "mydb.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cursor():** Creates a cursor object that acts as a channel for executing SQL statements against the database connection.\n",
    "- **execute(sql):** Executes the provided SQL statement using the current cursor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Order of Execution in SQL Queries**\n",
    "The order of execution in SQL queries follows a specific set of rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM (and JOINs):**\n",
    "   - The `FROM` clause specifies the tables involved in the query.\n",
    "   - If joins are used (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`), they are processed within this stage to combine data from multiple tables based on the join condition(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE:**\n",
    "   - The `WHERE` clause filters the data retrieved from the `FROM` clause based on the specified condition(s). Only rows that meet the `WHERE` criteria are considered further.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY (optional):**\n",
    "   - The `GROUP BY` clause, if present, groups the remaining rows based on the specified column(s). Rows with the same values in the grouping columns are placed into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING (optional):**\n",
    "   - The `HAVING` clause, used in conjunction with `GROUP BY`, filters the groups created in the previous step. It applies a condition to the groups themselves, and only groups that satisfy the `HAVING` criteria are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT:**\n",
    "   - The `SELECT` clause determines which columns and expressions you want to retrieve from the data. You can specify column names, aliases, and perform calculations using expressions within `SELECT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY (optional):**\n",
    "   - The `ORDER BY` clause, if included, sorts the final result set based on the specified column(s) in ascending or descending order (using `ASC` or `DESC` keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **LIMIT/OFFSET (optional):**\n",
    "   - These clauses (often used together) are used for pagination or result set limitation. `LIMIT` specifies the maximum number of rows to return, while `OFFSET` indicates the number of rows to skip before starting the result set.\n"
