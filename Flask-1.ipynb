    "**Q1. Flask Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:** Flask is a lightweight, versatile web framework written in Python. It provides a core set of tools and functionalities to simplify building web applications.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "    - **Flexibility:** Caters to both simple and complex web applications.\n",
    "    - **Simple and Easy to Learn:** Offers a clean, intuitive syntax with minimal boilerplate code.\n",
    "    - **Scalability:** Can be extended through a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and extensions.\n",
    "    - **Performance:** Generally efficient due to its minimalist nature.\n",
    "    - **Community:** Backed by a large and active community for support and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Simple Flask App (\"Hello World!\")**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import `Flask` from the `flask` module.\n",
    "2. Create a Flask application instance named `app`.\n",
    "3. Define a function `hello_world` decorated with the `@app.route('/')` decorator. This associates the function with the root URL (`/`).\n",
    "4. Inside the function, return the string \"Hello World!\".\n",
    "5. Within the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, use `app.run(debug=True)` to start the development server. The `debug=True` flag allows for automatic code reloading during development (changes take effect without restarting the server).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. App Routing in Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:** App routing is the mechanism that maps incoming URL requests to specific functions within your Flask application. It's analogous to a traffic light directing users to different sections of a website based on the URL they access.\n",
    "- **Importance:** App routes are essential for web applications because they allow you to create distinct pages or sections that handle different functionalities. Flask's routing system is flexible and extensible, enabling you to create complex URL patterns and dynamic routing based on parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Multiple Routes (\"/welcome\" and \"/\")**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def company_info():\n",
    "    return f\"\"\"\n",
    "    Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "    Location: India\n",
    "    Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import `Flask` as usual.\n",
    "2. Create a Flask app instance.\n",
    "3. Define two functions:\n",
    "   - `welcome()`: Decorated with `@app.route('/welcome')`, returns a welcome message for the `/welcome` URL.\n",
    "   - `company_info()`: Decorated with `@app.route('/')`, returns the company details using formatted string literals for the root URL (`/`).\n",
    "4. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block starts the development server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. URL Building with `url_for()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function:** Flask's `url_for()` function helps you generate URLs for your application's routes in a dynamic way. This is useful for building links within your templates or redirecting users based on actions.\n",
    "- **Syntax:** `url_for('endpoint_name', **kwargs)`\n",
    "  - `endpoint_name`: The name of the view function associated with the desired URL.\n",
    "  - `**kwargs` (optional): Keyword arguments to pass to the view function when generating the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    welcome_url = url_for('welcome')  # Generate URL for the '/welcome' route\n",
    "    return f'Click <a href=\"{welcome_url}\">here</a> to visit the welcome page.'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Flask app as before.\n",
    "2. Define two view functions:\n",
    "   - `index()`: Decorated with `@app.route('/')`, generates a link using `url_for('welcome')` to the `/welcome` route.\n",
    "   - `welcome()`: Serves the content for the `/welcome` URL."
