    "**Q1. Data Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** The process of transforming categorical data (text labels like colors or weekdays) into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. These algorithms typically work best with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Importance:** Encoding allows machine learning models to understand and utilize categorical features for prediction or classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Nominal Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A simple encoding technique that assigns unique integer values (0, 1, 2, ...) to each unique category. It preserves the order of the categories but doesn't inherently capture any relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** Imagine a dataset with a \"shirt color\" column containing values \"red,\" \"blue,\" and \"green.\" Nominal encoding might assign:\n",
    "    - \"red\": 0\n",
    "    - \"blue\": 1\n",
    "    - \"green\": 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. When to Prefer Nominal Encoding over One-Hot Encoding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low Cardinality (Unique Values):** When you have a small number of unique categories (less than 5-10), the increase in features with one-hot encoding might outweigh its benefits. Nominal encoding remains simpler.\n",
    "* **Ordinal Relationship Not Important:** If the order of categories doesn't significantly impact your model's predictions (e.g., \"shirt size\" categories), nominal encoding could be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** Suppose you're classifying customer satisfaction based on a \"service rating\" feature with values \"poor,\" \"average,\" and \"excellent.\" Nominal encoding might be appropriate as the order doesn't directly impact satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Choosing Encoding for 5 Unique Values Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "With 5 unique values, you could use either nominal encoding or one-hot encoding. Here's the reasoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nominal Encoding:** Creates 5 new columns (one for each category), which might still be manageable for this small number.\n",
    "* **One-Hot Encoding:** Also creates 5 new columns (one per category), but can be slightly more interpretable if the order of categories might hold some meaning for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice can depend on your specific use case and the importance of interpreting the model's coefficients. If you have domain knowledge suggesting order matters, one-hot encoding might be slightly better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Number of New Columns with Nominal Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given 1000 rows and 5 columns, where 2 are categorical with `x` unique values each:\n",
    "\n",
    "* New columns for categorical variables: 2 * x (one for each category in each column)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** If each categorical column has 4 unique values, nominal encoding would create 2 * 4 = 8 new columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Encoding for Animal Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the animal dataset with \"species,\" \"habitat,\" and \"diet\" features (assuming these are categorical):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Suitable technique:** One-hot encoding would be a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Justification:**\n",
    "    - Likely, these features have a higher number of unique categories than in the previous examples (e.g., numerous species names, habitat types, and diets).\n",
    "    - One-hot encoding helps the model learn relationships between categories (e.g., specific species might be associated with specific diets or habitats).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Encoding for Customer Churn Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step approach to encoding categorical data in the telecommunications churn dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Categorical Features:** Gender and Contract Type are categorical.\n",
    "2. **Choose Encoding Technique:** One-hot encoding is suitable here as it might capture relationships between categories (e.g., specific contract types might be more prone to churn).\n",
    "3. **Import Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "   from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load Data (Replace with your actual data):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   data = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "       \"Gender\": [\"M\", \"F\", \"M\", \"F\", ...],  # Replace with actual data\n",
    "       \"Age\": [30, 25, 40, 32, ...],\n",
    "       \"Contract Type\": [\"Prepaid\", \"Postpaid\", \"Prepaid\", ...],\n",
    "       \"Monthly Charges\": [50, 70, 65, 80, ...],\n",
    "       \"Tenure\": [24, 12, 36, 18, ...]\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encode Categorical Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False, handle_unknown='ignore')  # Adjust options as needed\n",
    "   encoded_data = pd.concat([data[['Age', 'Monthly Charges', 'Tenure']], pd"
