    "**Q1. Opening Files and Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function:** `open(filename, mode)` is used to open a file.\n",
    "- **Modes:**\n",
    "  - `'r'`: Opens a file for reading (existing file). Attempting to write to a read-only file will result in an error.\n",
    "  - `'w'`: Opens a file for writing. An existing file with the same name will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n",
    "  - `'a'`: Opens a file for appending. New data will be written to the end of the file.\n",
    "  - `'r+'`: Opens a file for both reading and writing (existing file).\n",
    "  - `'w+'`: Opens a file for both reading and writing. An existing file will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.\n",
    "  - `'a+'`: Opens a file for both appending and reading. New data will be written to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read a file\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write to a file (overwriting existing content)\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"New content\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Append to a file\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"a\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"More content\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Importance of `close()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `close()` method releases resources associated with the file object, making them available for other operations.\n",
    "- It's crucial to close files to:\n",
    "  - Prevent data corruption: Unclosed files might not have their data written completely to disk.\n",
    "  - Free up system resources: Open files occupy memory and file handles. Closing them releases these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Create, Write, Read a File**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a text file and write content\n",
    "with open(\"message.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"I want to become a Data Scientist\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open and read the content\n",
    "with open(\"message.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file into a string.\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads a single line from the file (including the newline character). Subsequent calls read the next line.\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all lines from the file and returns a list of strings (each line becomes an element in the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # Read entire content\n",
    "    all_content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(all_content)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Read line by line\n",
    "    file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning\n",
    "    line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "    line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line1, line2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Read all lines into a list\n",
    "    file.seek(0)  # Reset again\n",
    "    all_lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    print(all_lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. `with` statement with `open()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `with` statement simplifies file handling by ensuring the file is automatically closed even if an exception occurs during the `open()` operation or within the code block.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Cleaner code: No need for explicit `close()` calls.\n",
    "  - Error handling: If an exception occurs, the file is still closed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without with statement (risky)\n",
    "file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")  # File might not be closed if an exception occurs\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "file.close()  # Manual close\n",
    "\n",
    "# With with statement (recommended)\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()  # File is automatically closed even if an exception occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. `write()` and `writelines()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `write(string)`: Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "- `writelines(list_of_strings)`: Writes a sequence of strings (list) to the file, each string on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Write a string\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file"
