    " **Q1. MongoDB, NoSQL, and When to Choose It**\n",
    "\n",
    "**MongoDB:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A NoSQL (non-relational) document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.\n",
    "- Schema-less: Documents within a collection can have varying structures, allowing for easy adaptation to change.\n",
    "- Offers scalability, high performance, and support for dynamic queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A broad category of databases that deviate from the traditional relational model using tables and rows.\n",
    "- Employ various data models (document, key-value, graph, etc.) for different use cases and query patterns.\n",
    "- Often prioritize speed, scalability, and flexibility over strict consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Choose MongoDB over SQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Schema:** When data structure needs to evolve frequently or accommodate diverse data types.\n",
    "- **Large-Scale Data Handling:** For massive amounts of data, leveraging horizontal scaling and distributed architecture.\n",
    "- **Fast Queries and Performance:** Prioritizes read performance and responsiveness over strict transactional consistency.\n",
    "- **Handling Unstructured Data:** Effectively stores and queries unstructured or semi-structured data like text, logs, or product catalogs.\n",
    "- **Rapid Application Development:** Streamlines development with schema-less design and dynamic query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. MongoDB Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Model:** Stores data as flexible JSON-like documents with embedded structures and arrays.\n",
    "- **Schema-less:** Dynamically adapts to changes in data structure without rigid schema constraints.\n",
    "- **Horizontal Scalability:** Easily scales by distributing data across multiple servers for handling large datasets.\n",
    "- **Rich Query Language:** Supports expressive queries for retrieval, aggregation, and analysis using a JSON-like syntax.\n",
    "- **Indexing:** Optimizes query performance through indexing on various fields within documents.\n",
    "- **Replication:** Provides high availability and fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple servers.\n",
    "- **Aggregation Pipeline:** Enables complex data transformations and analysis using a pipeline of stages.\n",
    "- **Geospatial Support:** Optimizes queries for geospatial data (e.g., coordinates, locations) with geospatial indexing.\n",
    "- **GridFS:** Stores and retrieves large files efficiently, breaking them into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Python with MongoDB Connection**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "mycollection = mydb[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Q4. Inserting Records and Finding Them**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inserting a Single Record:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert a single document\n",
    "mycollection.insert_one({\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find the inserted document\n",
    "result = mycollection.find_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inserting Multiple Records:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert multiple documents\n",
    "mycollection.insert_many([\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"London\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 40, \"city\": \"Paris\"}\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find all inserted documents\n",
    "results = mycollection.find()\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Querying with `find()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find()` method retrieves documents based on specified criteria. It returns a cursor object, which you can iterate over to access results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find all documents where age is greater than 25\n",
    "results = mycollection.find({\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}})\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Sorting with `sort()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort()` method sorts results based on field(s) in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find all documents and sort by age in descending order\n",
    "results = mycollection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)  # -1 for descending\n",
    "for result in results:\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Deleting Documents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`delete_one(filter)`:** Deletes the first document that matches the filter.\n",
    "- **`delete_many(filter)`:** Deletes all documents that match the filter.\n",
    "- **`drop()`:** Drops (deletes) the entire collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Delete all documents with age 30\n",
    "mycollection.delete_many({\"age\": 30})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete the entire collection\n",
    "mycollection.drop()\n",
    "```\n"
